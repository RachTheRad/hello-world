# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the GitHub Flow. 
I am 37 and originally from Ohio. I've traveled and lived in several states throughout my life (from Michigan, to Ohio, to Illinois, to Colorado, with finally landing in Kentucy). My current profession is customer service but I want to do more and hopefully add to a Visual Communication Technology degree I received in 2010. I'm looking forward to learning so much. I'm married with one daughter and one dog (who thinks he's a cat) and I love coffee and fiber arts.
